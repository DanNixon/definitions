
This directory contains the source for an alternative rendering of the NeXus documentation.
The tool used here is sphinx.  It relies on source code files coded in reST.
See the sphinx WWW site for how this works:  http://sphinx.pocoo.org/

Development
-------------

When building the new sphinx documentation, 
commands similar to these might be useful when
sifting through the output::

   cp /dev/null makelog.txt
   logmake clean html
   grep introduction makelog.txt \
      | grep -v include          \
      | grep -v undefined        \
      | grep -v "not readable"   \
      | grep -v "not found"      \
      | grep -v Duplicate
