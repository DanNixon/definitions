NeXus Scientific Community 
-------------------------------------------------------

NeXus began as a group of scientists with the goal of defining a common 
data storage format to exchange experimental results and to exchange ideas 
about how to analyze them.

The NeXus Scientific Community provides the scientific data, advice, and 
continued involvement with the NeXus standard. NeXus provides a forum for 
the scientific community to exchange ideas in data storage through the 
NeXus wiki. [#wiki]_

The NeXus International Advisory Committee (see :ref:`NIAC-link`) 
supervises the development and maintenance of the NeXus common data format 
for neutron, x-ray, and muon science. The NIAC supervises a technical 
committee to oversee the NeXus Application Programmer Interface (NAPI) and 
the NeXus class definitions.
