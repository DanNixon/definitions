NeXus Introduction

.. index:: NeXus basic motivation; unified format

In recent years, a community of scientists and computer programmers working 
in neutron and synchrotron facilities around the world came to the 
conclusion that a common data format would fulfill a valuable function in 
the scattering community. As instrumentation becomes more complex and data 
visualization become more challenging, individual scientists, or even 
institutions, have found it difficult to keep up with new developments. A 
common data format makes it easier, both to exchange experimental results 
and to exchange ideas about how to analyze them. It promotes greater 
cooperation in software development and stimulates the design of more 
sophisticated visualization tools. For additional background information see 
:ref:`History`.

	*The programmers who produce intermediate files for 
	storing analyzed data should agree on simple interchange rules.*

.. index:: rules

This section is designed to give a brief introduction to NeXus, the data 
format and tools that have been developed in response to these needs. It 
explains what a modern data format such as NeXus is and how to write simple 
programs to read and write NeXus files.
