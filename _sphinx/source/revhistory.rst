3.2a	      2012-05	  Changing documentation source from DocBook to Sphinx                  PRJ
3.1.0	      2012-05	  Ready for release.                                                    PRJ
3.1           2012-02     Now using ``cmake`` to control multiplatform build                    PRJ
                          and packaging.
1.0b          2011-11     Preparing manual for initial release. Also                            PRJ
                          preparing to convert manual source from
                          DocBook to Sphinx for next release of manual.
draft         2010-11     Nearly complete but still much finishing work                         PRJ
                          remains. The description of dimensions and the
                          description of the coordinate system needs major
                          revision and improvement. More examples are
                          needed. The manual is now divided into two
                          volumes. Volume I is the User Manual, Volume II
                          is the Reference Documentation. Much of the
                          NXDL chapter in Volume II is autogenerated from
                          the ``nxdl.xsd`` Schema and the NXDL source
                          files.
  
                          Initial release of NXDL, manual, and next release 
                          of NAPI (compatibility release),
                          manual in editing stage, packaging tools need to be built.
initial draft 2010 spring Most of the content from the old NeXus                                PRJ
                          mediawiki documentation is included. Some new 
                          wiki content has been introduced but should be 
                          easy to identify for inclusion in the manual. 
..            2009-11	  Started conversion from the old NeXus mediawiki                       PFP
                          documentation.
