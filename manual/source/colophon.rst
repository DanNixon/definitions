These docs (manual and reference) were produced using Sphinx
(http://sphinx.pocoo.org).
The source for the manual shows many examples of the structures
used to create the manual.  If you have any questions about 
how to contribute to this manual, please contact the NeXus
Documentation Editor (Pete Jemian <jemian@anl.gov>).

.. note::
	The indentation is very important to the syntax of the 
	restructured text manual source.  Be careful not to mix 
	tabs and spaces in the indentation or the manual may not
	build properly.
